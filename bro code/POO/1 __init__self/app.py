"""__init__ Method 
__init__ is a special method in Python called the constructor. 
It is automatically called when you create a new object from a class. 
Its purpose is to initialize the object's attributes.
"""

""" What is self?
self represents the instance of the class.

It allows us to access and modify attributes specific to that object.

Every method inside a class must include self as the first parameter."""
